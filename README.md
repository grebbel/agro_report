# RENV
Use renv::init() to initialize renv with a new or existing project. This will set up your project with a private library, and also make sure to install all of the packages you're using into that library. The packages used in your project will be recorded into a lockfile, called renv.lock.  
  
As you work in your project, you may need to install or upgrade different packages. As these packages are installed, renv will automatically write renv.lock for you. The renv.lock lockfile records the state of your project's private library, and can be used to restore the state of that library as required.  
  
Later, if you need to port your project to a new machine, you can call renv::restore() to reinstall all of the packages as declared in the lockfile.
